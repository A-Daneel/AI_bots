I was directly intrigued by his way of being and we slowly became friends. I also started working as producer on his documentary film Portrait of a failed writer.\nAt the age of 23, right after finishing the first draft of his novel, Joris starts filming his own life. The novel keeps on getting rejected by publishing houses, but this doesn't make him reconsider his career ambition. He obsessively keeps on writing novels, for 17 years, while the gap widens between who he is and who he wants to be. He tries to ward off failure by turning himself into a fictional character within his cinematic existence. Yet he knows he will have to face up to reality sooner or later.\n\nFinally after all these years, Portrait of a failed writer is finished and this month we will start submitting it to film festivals around the world. If you have any advice hit me up.\n\nThe film is supported by @afk020, Mediafonds and was part of Summer Documentary Lab of @uniondocs New York 2015.\n\n#documentary #film #idfa #literature #documentaryfilm #writer #filmfestival\n15w"

No one wants to confront the fact that this may be more than just a cat.\" The old soap factory situated at 21 Don Roadway gives a glimpse of Toronto‚Äôs industrial heritage. Just before the site will be demolished and redeveloped in to a 12 million square foot of office and retail space, we invited a writer and a photographer to capture its extraordinary nature in a story. It reveals patterns of social decay, male pack behaviour, apathy and entropy.\n\nStory by @afsulli, photos by @benfreed and design by @studioponto.
